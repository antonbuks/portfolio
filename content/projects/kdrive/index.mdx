kDrive was a collaborative file management system I worked on at Infomaniak.
The front end was an Angular app we architected and built as a team of 6.

I was responsible for the file view components which consisted of a virtual scroll with drag and drop and drag selection functionnality
to fully match a desktop file browser experience.

The biggest challange was getting the drag select and drag and drop features to work in a virtual scroll 
as file dom elements had to be mounted in different states based on if they were previously selected
or a drag of a file was in progress for example.
